# README


  This repository contains the run_analysis.r script that is used to analyze data from the Samsung Galaxy S accelerometers. run_analysis.r takes the [dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and creates a new tidy dataset. The tidy dataset contains 180 observations of 81 variables. Information about the methods to construct the tidy dataset and about the variables it contains can be found in the Cookbook.md file.
  
  run_analysis.r contains code to download the original dataset but instructions are given if the user already has the data in the working directory.
